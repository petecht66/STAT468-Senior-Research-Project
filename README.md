This repository contains my complete work for STAT468, the Senior Research Project and Capstone for the undergraduate Statistics major at the University of Delaware within the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources. My STAT faculty mentor for this project is Professor Bryan Crissinger, who has taught many of the undergraduate STAT courses that I have completed.
